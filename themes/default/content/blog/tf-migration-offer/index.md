Many of our users come to Pulumi from existing infrastructure as code (IaC) tools like Terraform. They choose Pulumi because of the increased developer productivity and ability to harness the complexity of the cloud when using real programming languages. However, migrating existing IaC projects to Pulumi can come with a lot of challenges and time. Today, we announced converting full Terraform projects to Pulumi directly within the Pulumi CLI. Previously, the tf2pulumi tool could convert just snippets of Terraform to Pulumi. With the release, you can now convert the vast majority of complete Terraform projects. See Justin Van Pattenâ€™s [blog post](/blog/converting-full-terraform-programs-to-pulumi) for more details.

However, what if you and your organization have a lot of Terraform workspaces across many different projects to migrate? Accompanying the new Terraform conversion tooling, we are announcing the Terraform Migration Offer. As part of Pulumi Enterprise and Business Critical, we are including 10 and 25 Terraform workspace migrations, respectively, as part of the onboarding process. We will migrate all your Terraform HCL code to your favorite language and migrate the Terraform state. Additional workspace migrations can be purchased at an added cost.

The Terraform Migration Offer makes it easy to get onto Pulumi without becoming experts in migrating code and state. Signup below to take advantage of the offer today
